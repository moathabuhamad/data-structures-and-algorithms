# Queue with Stack  :
this code will create a stackQueuestack usibg two stackStackstack , stackPseudoQueuestack class will create the standard stackqueuestack interface .

## Challenge
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize stack2stack Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods: enqueue(value) , dequeue()

## Approach & Efficiency
- create two stacks and used the push method to add to the first stack and used pop to remove from the other one 
- push all the nodes in the first stackstackstack to the second one so when i used  pop .
- take what was first element added , to make the first in first out (stackqueuestack).
