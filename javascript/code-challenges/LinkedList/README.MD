# Singly Linked Lists 

[x] Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
[x] Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
[x] Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
[x] Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
[x] Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
[x] Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list



## Challenge Description 

**JS Linked List Insertions**  
Complete on the Singly LL implemented in the previous challenge, and add these 3 methods:
- append(value) --> to add a Node at the end of the LL
- insertBefore(value, newVal) --> to add a Node before a specific Node
- insertAfter(value, newVal) --> to add a Node after a specific Node  

## Approach & Efficiency
**Approach**  
- defining the classes for the Node and the Linked List
- impleminting the methods using conditional if statements and while loops
- visualizing the LL with an example to help impleminting the features and methods  

**Efficiency: Big O Notation**  
- Time Complexity:
  - O(n) --> for all methods
- Space Complexity:
  - O(1) for all methods
